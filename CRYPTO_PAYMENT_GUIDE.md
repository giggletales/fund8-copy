## Payment Verification Logic

### Ethereum Verification
```typescript
1. Fetch transaction details from Etherscan
2. Verify recipient address matches our wallet
3. Convert hex value to ETH
4. Check amount is within ±2% of expected
5. Return verification result
```

### Solana Verification
```typescript
1. Fetch transaction details from Solscan
2. Find token transfer to our wallet
3. Convert lamports to SOL
4. Check amount is within ±2% of expected
5. Return verification result
```

### Why 2% Tolerance?
- Accounts for network fees
- Price fluctuation during transaction
- Ensures legitimate payments aren't rejected

---

## UI/UX Features

### Amazing Animations
- Gradient text effects on pricing
- Hover animations on buttons
- Copy-to-clipboard with visual feedback
- Loading spinners during verification
- Success/failure state animations
- Glass morphism card effects
- Smooth transitions throughout

### Real-time Updates
- Live crypto price fetching
- Instant discount calculation
- Real-time coupon validation
- Immediate verification feedback

### User Feedback
- Copy confirmation (checkmark icon)
- Verification status messages
- Error handling with clear messages
- Loading states on async operations
- Success redirects with context

---

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only view their own payments
- Coupons are publicly viewable (active only)
- Payment creation restricted to authenticated users
- Update only for pending payments

### Data Protection
- API keys stored in code (for simplicity)
- Transaction hashes verified on blockchain
- Amount verification prevents fraud
- Wallet address validation

### Payment Safety
- No payment processing on server
- Direct blockchain verification
- Immutable transaction records
- Transparent payment tracking

---

## Admin Access

### Private Admin Dashboard
- Admin button removed from public navbar
- Admin panel still accessible at `/admin/mt5`
- Direct URL access required
- Can be further secured with admin-only auth

### Admin Payment Tracking
Query payments:
```sql
SELECT
  p.*,
  u.email,
  c.account_size
FROM payments p
JOIN auth.users u ON p.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN challenges c ON p.challenge_id = c.id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Payment Not Verifying
- Check transaction hash is correct
- Ensure correct amount was sent
- Verify sent to correct wallet address
- Wait for blockchain confirmation
- Check network (ETH mainnet, SOL mainnet)

### Coupon Not Working
- Check code is typed correctly (case-insensitive)
- Verify coupon hasn't expired
- Check max uses not exceeded
- Ensure coupon applies to selected challenge type

### Price Calculation Issues
- CoinGecko API might be rate-limited
- Refresh page to fetch new prices
- Check internet connection
- Prices update on component mount

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Improvements
1. Add testnet support for development
2. Implement automatic price refresh timer
3. Add payment history page for users
4. Create admin payment verification override
5. Add email notifications for payments
6. Implement refund system
7. Add more cryptocurrency options (USDT, USDC)
8. Create payment receipt generator
9. Add webhook notifications for payments
10. Implement automatic challenge activation

### Scaling Considerations
1. Move API keys to environment variables
2. Add payment queue system
