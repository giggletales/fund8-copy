## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

#### New Tables Created:

**`challenge_types`** - 5 different evaluation paths:
- Standard Challenge (2-phase, 8% → 5%, $79, 80% split)
- Rapid Challenge (1-phase, 10%, 10 days, $149, 90% split)
- Scaling Challenge (2-phase, 6% → 6%, $49, 95% split)
- Professional Challenge (1-phase, 12%, $299, 95% split)
- Swing Trader Challenge (2-phase, 15% → 10%, 60 days, $349, 90% split)

**`consistency_scores`** - Professional trading metrics:
- Overall score out of 10 (7.5+ required to pass)
- 6 component scores:
  - Win Rate Quality (15% weight)
  - Risk-Reward Ratio (20% weight)
  - Equity Curve Smoothness (20% weight)
  - Position Sizing Discipline (15% weight)
  - Emotional Control (15% weight)
  - Drawdown Recovery (15% weight)
- Supporting metrics: Sharpe ratio, profit factor, win rate, R:R ratio
- Behavioral flags: revenge trading, overtrading, position size violations
- Educational feedback and improvement suggestions

**`trade_analytics`** - Advanced analysis per trade:
- Risk metrics (risk %, R:R ratio, position size %)
- Timing analysis (hold duration, time between trades)
- Behavioral flags (revenge trade, oversized position, correlated trades)
- Stop loss analysis (distance in pips, T/P distance)

**`daily_performance`** - Daily statistics:
- Starting/ending balance, P&L, P&L %
- Trading activity (trades opened/closed, win rate)
- Quality metrics (daily win rate, avg R:R, profit factor)
- Flags (daily loss breach, overtrading detected)

**`advanced_metrics_cache`** - Real-time performance:
- Current consistency score, Sharpe ratio, profit factor
- Equity curve R² and slope
- Risk metrics (max drawdown, VaR, volatility)
- Pass probability estimation

#### Updated Tables:

**`challenges`** - Added fields:
- `challenge_type_id` - Reference to challenge type
- `current_phase` - Current phase (1 or 2)
- `consistency_score_latest` - Most recent score
- `sharpe_ratio_latest` - Most recent Sharpe ratio
- `passes_advanced_criteria` - Boolean flag

---

### 2. Frontend Components

#### New Pages:

**`/src/pages/Pricing.tsx`** - Professional pricing page:
- Displays all 5 challenge types from database
- Shows all rules and requirements transparently
- Highlights popular and best value options
- Clean, modern design with glassmorphism
- Lists professional features (consistency scoring, transparency, etc.)

#### Updated Components:

**`/src/App.tsx`** - Added `/pricing` route

---

### 3. Security (RLS Policies)

All new tables have Row Level Security enabled:

- **challenge_types**: Publicly viewable (for pricing page)
- **consistency_scores**: Users can only view their own scores
- **trade_analytics**: Users can only view their own trade data
- **daily_performance**: Users can only view their own performance
- **advanced_metrics_cache**: Users can only view their own metrics

---

## How It Works

### For Traders:

1. **Choose Challenge Type**: Select from 5 professional evaluation paths
2. **View All Requirements**: All rules clearly displayed upfront
3. **Trade Professionally**: Meet basic profit targets AND consistency requirements
4. **See Real-Time Metrics**: Advanced analytics included free
5. **Get Educational Feedback**: System helps improve trading skills
6. **Pass or Learn**: Either get funded or get detailed feedback on what to improve

### Consistency Scoring System:

The consistency score evaluates 6 key areas of professional trading:

1. **Win Rate Quality (15%)**
   - Optimal range: 45-65%
   - Too high (>75%) suggests risky strategies
   - Too low (<35%) suggests poor trade selection

2. **Risk-Reward Ratio (20%)**
   - Target: 1.8:1 to 2.5:1
   - Must let winners run longer than losers
   - Measures proper risk management

3. **Equity Curve Smoothness (20%)**
   - Linear regression R² score
   - Higher R² = more consistent growth
   - Professional target: R² > 0.85

4. **Position Sizing Discipline (15%)**
   - Consistent position sizes
   - Low coefficient of variation
   - Avoids sudden size jumps

5. **Emotional Control (15%)**
   - Detects revenge trading patterns
   - Monitors trading after losses
   - Flags oversized positions after losses

6. **Drawdown Recovery (15%)**
   - Speed of recovery from drawdowns
   - Controlled recovery (not aggressive)
   - Measures risk management during stress

**Passing Threshold**: 7.5/10 overall score required
