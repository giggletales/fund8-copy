## 🎓 Learning Resources

To understand the codebase:
1. Start with `src/App.tsx` - See routing
2. Read `src/services/apiService.ts` - API methods
3. Check `src/services/ruleMonitoringService.ts` - Auto breach
4. Review `src/lib/auth.ts` - Authentication
5. Explore `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - UI example

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Email sending** - Templates render but don't send (needs SMTP)
2. **Payment processing** - Simulated (needs Stripe)
3. **MT4/MT5 connection** - Not implemented (needs MetaAPI)
4. **Real-time updates** - Manual refresh needed (needs WebSockets)

These are **integration tasks**, not core functionality issues.
